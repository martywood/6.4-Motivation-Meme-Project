# 6.4-Motivation-Meme-Project
CSS Properties:

Motivational meme poster website based on the classic 90s motivational posters.

There is an image, styled with a border, background color, an h1 with custom font that is linked from Google in the head section and the text-transform property to make all uppercase, and a main paragraph.  A div element is used to contain the h1, p, and img elements.  A class is used for the div and img in the case there is a need to extend the website and reuse the CSS in the future.
